## About

TextExt is a plugin for jQuery which is designed to provide functionality such
as tag input and autocomplete.

The core design principle behind TextExt is modularity and extensibility. Each
piece of functionality is separated from the main core and can act individually
or together with other plugins.

TextExt's modular design allows you easily turn a standard HTML text input into a 
wide range of modern, tailored to your needs input field without bloating your 
source code and slowing down your site with the code that you aren't using.

A wide number of plugins are available including Tags, Autocomplete, Filter, Ajax
as well as a few which are purely aesthetic like Focus.

Please refer to the [manual] for the full API documentation and examples.
